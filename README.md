# Polestar for Homey

Unofficial Homey Pro integration for Polestar vehicles. Connects to Polestar's C3
cloud backend (the same one the Polestar mobile app uses) to expose vehicle
status and remote-control commands as Homey capabilities and flow cards.

## Supported vehicles

- **Polestar 4** — tested
- **Polestar 3** — should work via the shared C3 backend (unverified)
- **Polestar 2** — should work via C3; feedback from P2 owners welcome

Feature availability differs per car. The integration discovers exterior
contacts from each vehicle's reported fields and probes charging controls on every
successful startup. Unsupported capabilities are hidden automatically instead of
appearing as empty tiles. Charge-limit bounds are model-aware (Polestar 3: 40–100%
in 10% steps), while valid values returned by the vehicle API are always preserved.

## What's included

**Read**: battery level, charging status, power / current / voltage while
charging, session + lifetime kWh, range, odometer, interior + target
temperature, parking climatization state and time remaining, lock status,
individually named door, window and hatch contacts reported by the car, tyre
pressures (four wheels in kPa), service warnings and distance-to-service, last
known GPS location, OTA software update state.

**Write**: start/stop charging, set charge limit and amperage, lock/unlock,
unlock trunk, honk and flash, start/stop parking climatization (with
temperature, per-seat heating, steering-wheel heating), open/close all
windows.

All writes are exposed as both device tiles and flow action cards. A device
setting provides a master-switch to disable writes globally, and optional
features can be hidden per-device when unsupported.

## Configuration

Pair a vehicle with your Polestar ID email and password. Homey handles OIDC
authentication automatically; tokens refresh transparently.

## The `polestar-2-csv` driver

The older *Car Stats Viewer* webhook driver is marked deprecated — the main
`vehicle` driver now covers all its battery/charging/range functionality and
more. Existing devices keep working; no new pairings are accepted. P2 owners
who rely on the webhook for real-time driving telemetry (speed, gear, ignition,
battery temperature, trip summaries) can keep using it alongside the main
driver.

## Disclaimer

This integration is unofficial and not affiliated with or endorsed by Polestar
or Volvo Cars. Use at your own risk. Authentication uses reverse-engineered
endpoints that may change or break without notice.
